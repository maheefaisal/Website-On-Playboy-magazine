        <p>Playboy is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine, formerly in print and currently online. It
            was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from
            Hefner's mother.
            <br> <br>
            [3] Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude[4] models (Playmates), Playboy played
            an important role in the sexual revolution[5] and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown
            into Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), with a presence in nearly every medium.[6] In addition to the flagship
            magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide.
            <br><br>
            The magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke,[7] Ian
            Fleming,[7] Vladimir Nabokov,[8] Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse,[7] Roald Dahl,[9] Haruki
            Murakami, and Margaret Atwood.
            <br><br>
            [7] With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase
            for notable cartoonists, including Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Cole,[10] Eldon Dedini,[11] Jules Feiffer,[12] Shel
            Silverstein,[13] Erich Sokol,[7] Roy Raymonde,[14] Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson.[15] Playboy features
            monthly interviews of notable public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers,
            conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes,
            and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often
            interviews conservative celebrities.[16]

            The front cover of the first issue of Playboy, featuring Marilyn Monroe, December 1953
            After a year-long removal of most nude photos in Playboy magazine, the March–April 2017 issue brought back
            nudity.[17]
            <br><br>
            In March 2020, Ben Kohn, CEO of Playboy Enterprises, announced that the Spring 2020 issue would be the last
            regularly scheduled printed issue and that the magazine would now publish its content online.[18] The
            decision to close the print edition was attributed in part to the COVID-19 pandemic which interfered with
            distribution of the magazine.[18]

                Post–2000
                The magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the January 2004 issue. Celebrations were held at Las
                Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, and Moscow during the year to commemorate this event. Playboy also
                launched limited-edition products designed by a number of notable fashion houses such as Versace,
                Vivienne Westwood and Sean John. As a homage to the magazine's 50th anniversary, MAC Cosmetics released
                two limited-edition products, namely a lipstick and a glitter cream.[38]

                The printed magazine ran several annual features and ratings. One of the most popular was its annual
                ranking of the top "party schools" among all U.S. universities and colleges. In 2009, the magazine used
                five criteria: bikini, brains, campus, sex and sports in the development of its list. The top-ranked
                party school by Playboy for 2009 was the University of Miami.[39]

                In June 2009, the magazine reduced its publication schedule to 11 issues per year, with a combined
                July/August issue. On August 11, 2009, London's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that Hugh Hefner had
                sold his English manor house (next door to the famous Playboy Mansion) for $18 m ($10 m less than the
                reported asking price) to another American, Daren Metropoulos, the President and co-owner of Pabst Blue
                Ribbon, and that due to significant losses in the company's value (down from $1 billion in 2000 to $84
                million in 2009), the Playboy publishing empire is up for sale for $300 million.[40] In December 2009,
                they further reduced the publication schedule to 10 issues per year, with a combined January/February
                issue.

                On July 12, 2010, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced Hefner's $5.50 per share offer ($122.5 million
                based on shares outstanding on April 30 and the closing price on July 9) to buy the portion of the
                company he did not already own and take the company private with the help of Rizvi Traverse Management
                LLC. The company derives much of its income from licensing, rather than from the magazine.[41] On July
                15, Penthouse owner FriendFinder Networks Inc. offered $210 million (the company is valued at $185
                million), though Hefner, who already owned 70 percent of voting stock, did not want to sell.[42] In
                January 2011, the publisher of Playboy magazine agreed to an offer by Hefner to take the company private
                for $6.15 per share, an 18 percent premium over the price of the last previous day of trading.[43] The
                buyout was completed in March 2011.[44]

        <div class="center">
            <p>By spring 1953, Hugh Hefner—a 1949 University of Illinois psychology graduate who had worked in Chicago
                for Esquire magazine writing promotional copy; Publisher's Development Corporation in sales and
                marketing; and Children's Activities magazine as circulation promotions manager[19]—had planned out the
                elements of his own magazine, that he would call Stag Party.[20] He formed HMH Publishing Corporation,
                and recruited his friend Eldon Sellers to find investors.[20] Hefner eventually raised just over $8,000,
                including from his brother and mother.[21] However, the publisher of an unrelated men's adventure
                magazine, Stag, contacted Hefner and informed him it would file suit to protect their trademark if he
                were to launch his magazine with that name.[19][22] Hefner, his wife Millie, and Sellers met to seek a
                new name, considering "Top Hat", "Gentleman", "Sir'", "Satyr", "Pan" and "Bachelor" before Sellers
                suggested "Playboy".[22][23]

                The first issue, in December 1953, was undated, as Hefner was unsure there would be a second. He
                produced it in his Hyde Park kitchen. The first centerfold was Marilyn Monroe, although the picture used
                originally was taken for a calendar rather than for Playboy.[24] Hefner chose what he deemed the
                "sexiest" image, a previously unused nude study of Marilyn stretched with an upraised arm on a red
                velvet background with closed eyes and mouth open.[25] The heavy promotion centered around Marilyn's
                nudity on the already-famous calendar, together with the teasers in marketing, made the new Playboy
                magazine a success.[26][27] The first issue sold out in weeks. Known circulation was 53,991.[28] The
                cover price was 50¢. Copies of the first issue in mint to near-mint condition sold for over $5,000 in
                2002.[29]

                The novel Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, was published in 1953 and serialized in the March, April and
                May 1954 issues of Playboy.[30]

                An urban legend started about Hefner and the Playmate of the Month because of markings on the front
                covers of the magazine. From 1955 to 1979 (except for a six-month gap in 1976), the "P" in Playboy had
                stars printed in or around the letter. The legend stated that this was either a rating that Hefner gave
                to the Playmate according to how attractive she was, the number of times that Hefner had slept with her,
                or how good she was in bed. The stars, between zero and 12, actually indicated the domestic or
                international advertising region for that printing.[31]
                
                In October 2020, Playboy Enterprises announced a reverse merger with Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp, a
                special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). On February 11, 2021, PLBY Group, Inc. completed its merger
                and began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the PLBY ticker. PLBY Group, Inc. and its
                subsidiaries, including Playboy Enterprises, is headed by Ben Kohn, Chief Executive Officer, President &
                Director.[20][21]

                History
                Sales of Playboy magazine peaked in 1972 at over 7 million copies.[6] By 2015 the circulation had fallen
                to 800,000.[7] The company completed its shift to consumer products in 2020 with the shuttering of the
                magazine division, and is now known to generate more than $3 billion in consumer spending annually
                across 180 countries.[8]

                Playboy ran forty Playboy Club properties from 1960 to 1986. Playboy operated casinos in England from
                the mid-1960s to 1981, when they lost their operating license. Playboy also operated a casino in Nassau,
                Bahamas from 1978 to 1982.[9] From 1981 to 1984, the company was a partner in the Playboy Hotel and
                Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Playboy Enterprises was denied a permanent New Jersey gaming
                license and was forced to sell out to its partner, which changed the name of the hotel/casino to the
                Atlantis Hotel and Casino. The company returned to the nightlife business with the Playboy Club at the
                Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, which opened in 2006[10] and closed in 2012.[11] Other Playboy Clubs
                opened in Cancun, Macau, and London in 2010 and 2011.[12] Meanwhile, the company says it will open at
                least three Playboy stores in each of the next three years.[13]

                The Age reported in October 2008 that, for the first-time ever, Hugh Hefner was selling tickets to his
                celebrity-filled parties to offset his cash-flow problems due to setbacks Playboy Enterprises had
                suffered, including decreasing Playboy circulation, decreasing stock value, and ventures that have yet
                to turn a profit.[14] Christie Hefner released a memo to employees about her efforts to streamline the
                company's operations, including eliminating its DVD division and laying off staff.[15]

                In March 2011, founder Hugh Hefner succeeded in a bid to take Playboy private after 40 years as a
                publicly traded company. He partnered with private equity firm Rizvi Traverse.[16]

                Playboy Enterprises closed its former headquarters in the top office floors of 680 N. Lake Shore Drive
                in Chicago, Illinois, in April 2012.[17] In January 2013, the company said it employed 165.[3]

                In 2018, less than a year after Hugh Hefner's death, his estate sold its remaining Playboy shares of
                33%, worth $35 million, to Icon Acquisition Holdings LP. The money was split between Hefner's widow and
                his four children.[18]

                On March 18, 2020, CEO Ben Kohn announced that the Spring issue of the magazine would be the last to be
                printed, and the publication would be online-only going forward.[19]
